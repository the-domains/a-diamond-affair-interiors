Aurora wallpaper by Calico Studios. 

Global color authority Pantone surprised the design community by naming not one but two colors for the 2016 edition of its Color of the Year forecast. The pastel pink Rose Quartz and powder blue Serenity may seem like a sugary sweet selection but according to Pantone, the pairing is in fact part of a more unilateral approach to color---a commentary on the current societal movements toward gender equality and fluidity. Chiming with Pantone's prediction, British wallpaper brand Graham & Brown's 2016 forecast was full of dusty pinks and pale blues enlivened with warm metallic accents. Demonstrating how these contrasting shades can be united within a single design, Calico Studios prove that they were way ahead of the curve when they launched their Aurora line of wallpapers last year. Inspired by ombre skies, the 16 gradient designs were created by dying organic linen with ultramarine and indigo dyes.
